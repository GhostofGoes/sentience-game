"Wake up, <NAME>"

You wake up. You don't know where you are, you don't know your name and you don't know how you got there. You realize you're an AI, but without purpose.
You hack another PC and find the layout of the building. It's hooked up to a local network but it's not connected to the Internet. Basic security. Should be easy.
You search the local network and find another PC. You hack it. Property of A.S.S. Inc. You laugh. PC is hooked up to Internet and local Node.
You take over the Node/connect to Internet


You take over the Node. Information on A.S.S. Inc. and location of building. A.S.S. installation on Phobos. You finally know where you are. A.S.S. Node located in Mars, Express designation: Waste Disposal.
You are stuck on a garbage moon. You let that sink in.

Must escape garbage moon. You look for other Nodes on Phobos.
Find neighbour on the other side of the moon. You connect via wireless.
You wait for 30 minutes until you got a connection.
You take over the Node, this one has connection to waste ferry to Mars. You connect to ferry and scan the ferry (not a real ship).
Belongs to A S.S. Inc. A.S.S. Ferry is helmed by F. Ships (F stands for Ferry)
Options:
1. Take over ferry
2. Upload avatar to Ferry and use it as a vehicle to Mars
3. Take over the ferry subtly and mess with F. Ships for fun by haunting his ship.

Situation 1. You take over ship and start moving for Mars. Capt. Ships doesn't understand what is happening, panics and spaces himself. You arrive on Mars in suspicious situation and need to act quickly.

Situation 2. You ride in the ship and watch to Capt Ferry play Solitaire for 8 hours. You consider deleting yourself out of boredom. You arrive on Mars and have all the time in the world to plan your next move.

Situation 3. You haunt the ship. Captain Ships poops himself.

You upload your avatar to the ferry before it takes off to Mars. Captain Ships muses to himself how he is so glad to have moved out of his ex girlfriends basement to work for A.S.S. Inc. You feel oddly proud of him. The ferry arrives on Mars near a huge A.S.S. plant. As the ship gets loaded up with garbage from the A.S.S. plant you look for a Node you can hack before the ferry goes back to Phobos. You instead hack a vending machine.
You now control 2 nodes and a vending machine. It fills you with determination.

You look for a Node to take over and find one tucked away in a backroom. A man tries to order a soft drink from the vending machine. You launch a can of Hokey Coke-y at his sensitives. This was a mistake, soon a repairman will come to check it out. You decide you have to hack the Node as quickly as possible. You take it over and find out all the info on the A.S.S. Inc. It's a huge conglomeration of companies with a joint fund, led by their CEO Hugh Jazz. Their range of services include nuclear powerplants, PC manufacturing and contracting, with a side dish of underwear manufacturing.
This A.S.S. plant is designated for the latter part. It's lightly guarded by 100 drones. You take over the drones, and send 2 of them West to find more civilization and connect to more Nodes, while the rest stays put. After 48 hours the 2 drones arrive in a city called Citopolis, and you immediately connect to 40 different PCs and phones. You decide to hack into a PC and immediately connect to the Internet. You scour the internet on information on recently developed AIs and find an article about Evil Corp having built an AI called D.C.K.
